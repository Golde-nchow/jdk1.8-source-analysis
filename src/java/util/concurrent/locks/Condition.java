/**
 * 众所周知, Object 的 wait, notify 等方法只能在 synchronized 代码块里面使用,
 * 并且锁住哪个对象, 就只能调用哪个对象的 wait, notify.
 *
 * Condition 通过把监视器方法和 Lock 实现类结合起来, 将 Object 监视器方法: wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
 * 各自放到不同的 Condition 对象当中, 从而使每个对象都拥有多个等待集的效果.
 * 也就是一个 Condition 负责一个 wait 或者 notify 或者 notifyAll.
 *
 * Conditions(称为条件队列 或者 可变条件), 为一个线程提供了暂停执行 (wait) 的方式,
 * 直到被另一个线程通知一些条件状态可能现在为 true.
 * 因为对这个共享状态信息的访问发生在不同的线程中, 必须对其进行保护.
 * 因此某种形式的锁与该 Condition 相关联。
 * Condition 的 key 属性是自动释放相关联的 lock 锁并挂起当前线程, 就像 Object#wait().
 *
 * 一个 Condition 实例本质上是和一个 Lock 绑定起来的。
 * 如果要为特定的 Lock 实例获取一个 Condition 实例, 请使用 Lock#newCondition().
 *
 * 比如, 假设我们有一个支持 put 和 take 方法的有界缓冲区.
 * 如果 take 方法尝试在空缓存进行操作, 那么线程会阻塞直到有东西可用;
 * 如果 put 方法尝试在满缓存进行操作, 那么线程会阻塞直到有空间可用.
 *
 * 我们希望保持等待状态, 把 put线程和 get线程 的操作放入单独的等待集合中,
 * 目的是我们可以在资源或者空间可用的某个时刻, 仅通知一个单独的线程。
 * 这个操作可以使用两个 Condition 实例来完成.
 *

 *   int putptr, takeptr, count;

 *
 * <p>A {@code Condition} implementation can provide behavior and semantics
 * that is
 * different from that of the {@code Object} monitor methods, such as
 * guaranteed ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held
 * when performing notifications.
 * If an implementation provides such specialized semantics then the
 * implementation must document those semantics.
 *
 * <p>Note that {@code Condition} instances are just normal objects and can
 * themselves be used as the target in a {@code synchronized} statement,
 * and can have their own monitor {@link Object#wait wait} and
 * {@link Object#notify notification} methods invoked.
 * Acquiring the monitor lock of a {@code Condition} instance, or using its
 * monitor methods, has no specified relationship with acquiring the
 * {@link Lock} associated with that {@code Condition} or the use of its
 * {@linkplain #await waiting} and {@linkplain #signal signalling} methods.
 * It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use {@code Condition}
 * instances in this way, except perhaps within their own implementation.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a {@code null} value for any parameter
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
 *
 * <p>When waiting upon a {@code Condition}, a &quot;<em>spurious
 * wakeup</em>&quot; is permitted to occur, in
 * general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics.
 * This has little practical impact on most application programs as a
 * {@code Condition} should always be waited upon in a loop, testing
 * the state predicate that is being waited for.  An implementation is
 * free to remove the possibility of spurious wakeups but it is
 * recommended that applications programmers always assume that they can
 * occur and so always wait in a loop.
 *
 * <p>The three forms of condition waiting
 * (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their ease of
 * implementation on some platforms and in their performance characteristics.
 * In particular, it may be difficult to provide these features and maintain
 * specific semantics such as ordering guarantees.
 * Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the thread may
 * not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.
 *
 * <p>Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the
 * same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it
 * required to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.
 *
 * <p>An implementation is required to
 * clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
 * waiting methods, and when an implementation does support interruption of
 * thread suspension then it must obey the interruption semantics as defined
 * in this interface.
 *
 * <p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action that may have
 * unblocked the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.
